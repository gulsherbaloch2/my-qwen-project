# Module 2: The Robotic Brain

This module explores the computational systems that process sensor data, make decisions, and control robotic behavior. Just as the brain processes information to enable intelligent behavior in biological systems, the "robotic brain" encompasses the algorithms, models, and computational architectures that enable intelligent robotic systems.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:

- Understand the role of AI in robotic systems
- Know different approaches to robot control and decision-making
- Be familiar with machine learning techniques applied to robotics
- Understand the challenges in implementing intelligent robotic behavior

## Module Overview

This module covers:

1. **Machine Learning in Robotics** - Learning from data and experience
2. **AI Control Systems** - Algorithms for robot decision-making and control

We'll explore both traditional and modern approaches to building intelligent robotic systems, including supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and specialized architectures for robotic applications.
