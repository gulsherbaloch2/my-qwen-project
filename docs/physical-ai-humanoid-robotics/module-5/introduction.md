# Module 5: Learning and Adaptation

This module explores how robots can learn from experience and adapt to new situations. As environments change and tasks evolve, the ability to learn and adapt becomes critical for robotic systems to remain effective and efficient.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:

- Understand reinforcement learning techniques for robotics
- Know how to implement imitation learning systems
- Appreciate the challenges in robot learning
- Be able to design adaptive robotic systems

## Module Overview

This module covers:

1. **Reinforcement Learning** - Learning through interaction and reward
2. **Imitation Learning** - Learning from expert demonstrations

These approaches represent the primary paradigms for enabling robots to acquire new skills and adapt their behavior based on experience.
