# Module 3: Robotic Motion and Control

This module focuses on the mathematical and computational foundations that enable robots to move, manipulate objects, and maintain balance. Understanding how robots move and be controlled is essential for creating effective robotic systems that can interact with the physical world.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:

- Master the fundamentals of robot kinematics and dynamics
- Understand how to plan and execute robot movements
- Know various control techniques for precise motion execution
- Be able to simulate and analyze robotic systems

## Module Overview

This module covers:

1. **Kinematics** - Geometric aspects of robot motion
2. **Dynamics** - Forces and torques affecting robot motion

Together, these topics provide the theoretical and practical foundation for understanding and controlling robot motion in various contexts.
