# Module 4: Perception and Sensing

This module focuses on how robots perceive and understand their environments. The ability to sense and interpret the world is fundamental to robot intelligence, enabling robots to navigate, manipulate objects, and interact meaningfully with their surroundings.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:

- Understand computer vision techniques for robot perception
- Know how to fuse information from multiple sensors
- Be able to implement basic perception algorithms
- Appreciate the challenges in real-world robot perception

## Module Overview

This module covers:

1. **Computer Vision** - Processing visual information for robotic tasks
2. **Sensor Fusion** - Combining data from multiple sensors effectively

These topics provide the foundation for building robotic systems that can effectively understand and interact with their environments.
