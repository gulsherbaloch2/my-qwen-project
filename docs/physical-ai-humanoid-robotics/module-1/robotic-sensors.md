# Robotic Sensors

Robotic sensors are the primary means by which robots perceive and understand their environment. This section explores the various types of sensors used in robotics, their characteristics, and applications.

## Types of Robotic Sensors

Robotic sensors can be broadly classified into two categories:

### Internal Sensors
- **Encoders**: Measure joint angles and positions
- **Force/Torque Sensors**: Measure internal forces and torques
- **Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs)**: Measure acceleration and angular velocity
- **Temperature Sensors**: Monitor component temperatures

### External Sensors
- **Cameras**: Provide visual information (2D/3D)
- **LiDAR**: Distance measurement using laser light
- **Ultrasonic Sensors**: Distance measurement using sound waves
- **Tactile Sensors**: Detect contact and pressure
- **GPS**: Global positioning information
- **Magnetometers**: Measure magnetic fields

## Sensor Characteristics

When selecting sensors for robotic applications, several characteristics are important:

- **Accuracy**: How close the measurement is to the true value
- **Precision**: How consistent the measurements are
- **Resolution**: The smallest change detectable by the sensor
- **Range**: The minimum and maximum values the sensor can measure
- **Response Time**: How quickly the sensor responds to changes

## Integration Challenges

Robotic sensors present several integration challenges:

- **Sensor Fusion**: Combining data from multiple sensors to obtain accurate information
- **Calibration**: Ensuring sensor accuracy over time and changing conditions
- **Noise Filtering**: Removing unwanted signals from sensor data
- **Synchronization**: Coordinating data from multiple sensors in time
