# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System

In this foundational module, we explore the critical components that allow robots to perceive their environment and interact with the physical world. Just as biological nervous systems enable organisms to sense and respond to stimuli, robotic sensing and actuation systems form the basis of all robotic capabilities.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:

- Understand the various types of sensors used in robotics
- Know the fundamental principles of robotic actuators
- Be able to integrate sensing and actuation systems
- Appreciate the challenges in building robust sensory-motor loops

## Module Overview

This module covers:

1. **Robotic Sensors** - Types, characteristics, and applications
2. **Robotic Actuators** - Motor types, control, and integration
3. **Sensor-Actuator Integration** - Building responsive systems

Each topic includes theoretical foundations, practical examples, and hands-on exercises to solidify your understanding.
