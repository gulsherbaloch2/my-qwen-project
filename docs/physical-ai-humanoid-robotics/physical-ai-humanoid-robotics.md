# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Curriculum

This comprehensive curriculum is designed to guide you through the fascinating world of physical AI and humanoid robotics. We'll explore how artificial intelligence and robotics converge to create systems that can perceive, learn, adapt, and interact with the physical world in increasingly sophisticated ways.

## Curriculum Structure

The curriculum is organized into six interconnected modules that build upon each other to provide a comprehensive understanding:

- **Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System** - Foundation of robotic perception and action
- **Module 2: The Robotic Brain** - Intelligence and control systems
- **Module 3: Robotic Motion and Control** - Kinematics and dynamics
- **Module 4: Perception and Sensing** - How robots understand their environment
- **Module 5: Learning and Adaptation** - AI techniques for adaptable robots
- **Module 6: Human-Robot Interaction** - Communication and ethical considerations

## Prerequisites

To get the most from this curriculum, you should have:

- Basic understanding of programming (preferably Python)
- Fundamental knowledge of calculus and linear algebra
- Basic understanding of probability and statistics
- Familiarity with machine learning concepts is beneficial but not required

## Learning Approach

This curriculum combines theoretical concepts with practical implementations. Each module includes:

- Detailed explanations of core concepts
- Code examples and implementation guides
- Exercises and challenges
- Research papers and additional resources
